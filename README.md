# BCA-4C-JAVA
Dear Students, Java first assignment need to complete on time

Encapsulation in Java is the process by which data (variables) and the code that acts upon them (methods) are integrated as a single unit. By encapsulating a class's variables, other classes cannot access them, and only the methods of the class can access them. 
Create a class EMPLOYEE having data members as NameOfEmp, Emp-Id, BasicSalary and GrossSalary. NameOfEmp, Emp-Id, BasicSalary should be entered as user input. Calculate HRA (HRA is 25% of BasicSalary).Also, calculate DA (DA is 40% of BasicSalary). Then, calculate GrossSalary (GrossSalary=BasicSalary+HRA+DA). 
Implement the following queries: 
a) Display the NameOfEmp and GrossSalary of employees whose name starts With a consonent.
b) Display the Emp-Id and GrossSalary of Employees whose Emp-Id is between 101 and 150.
c) Count the total number of Employees whose GrossSalary is less than 35000/-
